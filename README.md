## 🧩 Example Prompts Used During Development

When using **Cursor AI** or **Lovable AI tools**, seasoned engineers crafted prompts like:

### System Architecture & PRD

> *"Generate a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a pregnancy reminder app that sends clinic visit reminders monthly in trimester 1, bi-weekly in trimester 2, and weekly in trimester 3. Include features for emergency support, health tips, and monetization through Instasend API."*

### Frontend Development

> *"Build a React Native dashboard component that displays current pregnancy week, today’s reminder, and quick links to Reminders, Wellness, and Emergency pages. Use Tailwind CSS for styling."*

### Backend Development

> *"Create a Node.js Express API with routes for user registration, pregnancy tracking, reminders scheduling, and Instasend payment handling. Ensure JWT-based authentication."*

### Monetization Integration

> *"Write code to integrate Instasend API for subscription payments in M-Pesa. Include success/failure callbacks and update user premium status in PostgreSQL."*

### Testing & QA

> *"Generate Jest unit tests for the reminder scheduling logic to confirm that reminders trigger monthly (months 1–3), bi-weekly (months 3–6), and weekly (months 6–9)."*
